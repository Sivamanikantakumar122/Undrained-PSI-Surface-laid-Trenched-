# Undrained-PSI-Surface-laid-Trenched-
Pipe-soil interaction (PSI) is a critical aspect of offshore geotechnical engineering. When transporting oil and gas from a Central Processing Platform (CPP) to the shore via pipelines, understanding soil resistance is essential. This application allows users to evaluate how a pipeline responds under both surface-laid and trenched condition
